                                        <p>Since I was overqualified to apply for a full-time MBA, I took a decision to run for an executive MBA program. I was told that most schools would accept me even with an average eGMAT score, so I was relatively calm waiting for my exam. And then I took a mock test… My score for the math section was terribly low, and the verbal part of the test was, at most, average.</p>
                                        <p>Worrying about the upcoming exam, I rushed to search for some GMAT courses in my native city. Having found none, I purchased a Supreme Prep Pack from Cracker. In less than a month, I had submitted six essays, completed all courses and learnt most of the idioms attached to one of the Sentence Correction topics. Every week I had a session with Kyle, one of the Cracker’s tutors. He gave me important recommendations and built a manageable schedule. In the end of my preparation process I took three diagnostic tests and, pleased with the scores (670, 710, and 660), took the eGMAT test. My score was 156, which, as I later found out, was more than enough. All that being said, thank you guys for getting me prepared in such a short term!</p>

                                        <p>It was my first and, fortunately, my last attempt. When I found out that I had to take the LSAT, I startedsearching for a prep company to get some assistance. One of their managers contacted me a couple of hoursafter I registered and suggested several prep options. I decided to buy the package with live sessions. I hadtwo of them at the very beginning, during which Osama made a perfect study schedule for me. I followed theschedule and hit 158 for my LSAT.</p>
                                        <p>Speaking of my experience with the platform, it was pretty smooth. The platform has around 1,000 differentquestions, which are arranged by topic. You also have an option of looking up an unfamiliar notion in the listof terms and definitions. Honestly, I did not use it too often. What was really valuable to me is an easy-to-understand structure of the platform and the 'progress analysis' button. The platform also has clearly writtenexplanations for every single question.</p>

                                        <p>My GMAT success story started over a year ago, when I found out that I had to score at least 600 to apply for my master’s program. Although I am not a native English speaker, I felt like I could hit a high percentile for the verbal section of the test before even I started my preparation with Cracker; however, my math skills were relatively poor. So, after a couple of days spent searching for the best GMAT prep I decided to buy a Premium Pack on gmatcracker.com. At first, I was choosing between a Premium Prep Pack and a Comprehensive Prep Pack, but after the guys from Cracker told me that I would have an opportunity to communicate with GMAT tutors with a Premium Prep Package, I picked the former.</p>
                                        <p>The ‘platform’, as they call it, has a user-friendly interface. I spent a month watching video tutorials and doing online tasks and then took one of the three diagnostic tests that I had at my disposal. I scored 610 for my first try, and approximately in a week, as one of the tutors recommended, I took my second diagnostic test and got 630. I then immediately booked my real GMAT test. The most challenging thing about the GMAT exam is to watch patiently that download icon rotating in the middle of the screen after you have answered the last question… In a moment, a pop-up screen showed 650!</p>
                                        <p>I would like to express my gratitude to the entire Cracker Team for leading me by the hand during my preparation process!</p>

                                        <p>My test preparation started with tons of books and PDFs on different LSAT topics. Although I achieved somerelative progress, I felt I was wasting too much time because my approach to learning was haphazard. I couldspend a day studying critical reasoning, another day reading long LSAT passages and then take a week off tohave some rest. It could continue endlessly, and I decided to push myself and purchased an access for the LSAT Platform.</p>
                                        <p>At first, I was surprised by how the platform was structured. Everything was arranged intuitively, nohardships with navigating. Although the question bank of the LSAT Platform is somewhat smaller than that ofthe GMAT Platform, I felt like it was more than enough. Among most useful functions is the progress analysiswhich allows you to see what specific areas need more of your attention.</p>
                                        <p>All in all, I spent up to 2 months drilling the platform and finally scored 162.</p>

                                        <p>I started my GMAT preparation approximately a year ago. Since my final goal was to apply for an MBA into one of the top US business schools, I needed a total score of over 700. </p>
                                        <p>At the very beginning, I thought I could get prepared for the test by myself. I ordered an Official Guide 2016 and spent over two monts practicing. At first it seemed that everything was going good and when I hit 76% total for one of the free CATs I booked my exam and wasted $250. I got 510 which was not what I expected…</p>
                                        <p>I came home totally devastated and started surfing the Internet trying to understand what had gone wrong. I read a story of one of the guys from India who had failed his first try but hit 690 for his second try in just a couple of weeks, so I decided to take the test again in a month. Unfortunately, my second score was 530.</p>
                                        <p>I spent weeks in search of the most appropriate way to prepare for the test. Eventually, I decided not to disperse my efforts trying to learn everything that was on the Internet.</p>
                                        <p>Having spent over two months on learning with GMAT Cracker Platform, I understood that I had wasted so much time studying on my own. Soon after I started my preparation, my success rate in the verbal section rose by 20%. The platform made me much more confident with the time limit and what I found most useful is the ability to communicate with GMAT tutors right through the platform.</p>
                                        <p>My third attempt exceeded my expectations. Cracker Diagnostic Tests are tough and I scored in the range of 600-710 in all of the diagnostic tests available on the platform. The official GMAT exam, however, made me even more happy: I scored 730!</p>

                                        <p>In 2018, I decided to pursue a MBA degree for two mutually exclusive reasons: a) I wanted to get promoted at the company I worked for and b) I also wanted to change my location for one of the developed countries. I was aiming only at top universities, so the GMAT score of over 700 was a must.</p>
                                        <p>I found a GMAT tutor in my city and learnt the GMAT fundamentals with him. However, I felt he had a somewhat haphazard approach to teaching the GMAT and, what is more important, I couldn’t get more than 630 for my trial tests. At that moment, I took a decision to change my own approach and bought a Comprehensive Prep Package. Every day I spent 2-3 hours on the GMAT preparation, doing GMAT problems online and reading explanations. The ‘my progress’ feature helped me determine my weaknesses and work on them in the test generator. Unfortunately, I did not spend too much time on writing essays and submitted only two; as a result, I got 3,5 for it on the real GMAT test. However, my total score was 710. I knew that according to universities’ guidelines, 710 was more than enough. Nevertheless, I took my second try in approx. 20 days and got 730 without practicing much between my attempts! To put it brief, the GMAT Cracker platform helped me overcome the barrier of 630 and improve my score by 100 points. </p>

                                        <p>MBA is a trend nowadays, so back in 2017 I wanted to be trendy and to allow myself to have a good career. I surfed the Internet and found several business schools in US that could satisfy my career needs. They all set a minimum score requirement of 700, so I knew I would have to work much on GMAT because I am neither a native speaker nor a math guru.</p>
                                        <p>My preparation process started when I bought the GMAT Official Guide. It has a lot of practice tasks but relatively little theory, which is why I downloaded several GMAT prep books. The problem was that I could not get all my ducks in a row: I studied tons of material but did not have any structural approach and the whole GMAT was a mess of rules that I could not memorize.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, I bought a Premium Prep Pack at gmatcracker.com. Speaking of the GMAT Cracker Platform, it is easy to use and has a lot of learning resources that are clear and concise. The most precious thing about the platform is that all that mess of rules is clearly split into topics in such a way that the next topic is somewhat dependent on the previous topic, which gave the feeling of concision and coherence. The platform does not say what I have to memorize but it rather shows how I need to understand this or that rule to learn it more easily. The total time spent on the GMAT preparation reached one year, with approximately 2 months spent working on the platform. My final GMAT score is 720, which I hit for my second try.</p>

                                        <p>I knew little about MBA before one of my friends told me he was going to apply for it. He told me everything about it and I felt I wanted to improve my career, too. The only obstacle that I faced was a lack of money to pay for my study, so I started searching for scholarships and found out that the Fulbright Program sponsored by the US government compensates for both MBA program itself and living costs. However, to win the scholarship I had to score over 700 for my GMAT exam.</p>
                                        <p>Cracker was the first link I found on Google when searching for GMAT prep tools. I watched the video review on their web page, read through all the features listed on the main page, and decided to purchase a Comprehensive Prep Pack. I was granted access to the platform immediately and in a moment, I was solving GMAT problems on the platform.</p>
                                        <p>What I like most about the tool is that it provides you with a comprehensive dictionary where you can find terms and notions arranged in alphabetic order. I strongly believe that this feature is extremely effective: whenever I forgot a rule or a formula I would go to the dictionary and find it in no time. The entire preparation process took me up to 2 months. I did not have any tutoring sessions, but I did submit all my essays. On average, it can take the GMAT tutors up to one day to evaluate your analytical writing.</p>
                                        <p>When I felt I was ready to take the real GMAT, I scheduled my exam and in a week hit 720. I contacted the Fulbright office and they told me that I could try to apply. As a resut, I am a full-time MBA student now.</p>

                                        <p>First, I want to thank Cracker and its entire team for a high-quality support and top GMAT tutors who made gigantic efforts to get me where I am now.</p>
                                        <p>Speaking of my story, it all started about a year ago when I was a 26-year old tennis player who wanted to set his foot in the world of business, which was the main reason I started my GMAT preparation to pursue a MBA degree. Columbia University, which I preferred to all other options, required the GMAT score of over 710 which seemed unlikely to me because I had no mathematical background.</p>
                                        <p>One of my former classmates who was also going to apply for a full-time MBA recommended me to prepare with GMAT Cracker, and now I can say that I don’t regret it. I filled out a short form on their webpage to find out more about the differences between the prep packs and after a brief discussion I bought a premium pack since it allows to communicate directly with tutors by using a chat box integrated into the platform.</p>
                                        <p>The platform itself is a sufficient means to get prepared for the GMAT since it has all the needed theoretical and practical material. When studying on the platform, I skipped the video tutorials to save time and only read PDF extractions from their book. It turned out to be sufficient. Only after had I taken all diagnostic tests available did I schedule my exam. When I started my real test I was a bit nervous but then managed to calm down and finished the test. It seemed that sentence correction tasks were easier in the real test than on the platform. Anyways, I hit 740 (diagnostic tests scores: 690, 670, and 730).</p>

                                    <div class="popup-story__text">
                                        <p>My success story started when I was in my fourth year of bachelor degree. My parents insisted that I continue my study abroad because the quality of education in my country is far below that in most developed countries, so basically it was my parents decision that I received a masters degree in a foreign country. Since by that time I had been to many countries and was already familiar with many cultures it was not a big deal for me to pick the University. I was choosing between Rotterdam school of management and IE.</p>
                                        <p>later I found out that I had to pass the GMAT exam to apply for either of them. Although the required score was lower than 700, I still worried about my exam because I had never taken any similar test before. After I took CAT, I started worrying even more. The critical reasoning part of the test seemed monstrous to me at that time. My math skills were insufficient to answer correctly at least 60% of the questions in the quantitative section. As a result my first CAT was 410.</p>
                                        <p>I told my parents that I would never score more than 500 for the test. They decided to hire a tutor for me. The tutor helped me greatly with the math section, but sentence correction questions and, especially, critical reasoning tasks were beyond my understanding. I wanted to find a resource which a) contained all the needed material, b) had that material clearly sorted so I had structural understanding of what I was learning, and c) had a sufficient number of questions for me to be able to practice a lot. Eventually, I clicked on the Cracker’s banner on google and bought a premium prep pack.</p>
                                        <p>My first impression was positive. The platform has tons of useful features, among which I would single out a) the test generator, b) a comprehensive list of different GMAT terms and notions, c) clear structure of the test, and, of course, d) online tutor support. The last thing is super helpful. Whenever you are stuck with a question or simply do not understand something, click on a tutor support button and ask a tutor. As a rule, they respond in less than several hours; as I understand, it depends on the time of the day.</p>
                                        <p>My approach towards learning was simple: I first read all the theoretical material and watched video tutorials on a definite topic and only then did practice questions. It is important that the ratio of theory to practice is at least 1:2. I spent up to two months on preparation and then hit 680 on my first try.</p>
                                        <p>One more thing. At the very beginning, I did not understand why I had to take the GMAT exam and it seemed unfair to me that regardless of what major you choose you have to pass this test. However, now I can say that the preparation for the exam was a precious experience and that I learned much from it. This exam sorts out those candidates who are not able to study under pressure, whether it is foreign environment or the necessity to cooperate with people you may not like. Thank you Cracker for giving me an opportunity to study abroad and receive my masters degree at RSM.</p>

                                        <p>After I finished my third school year, I had to decide on what I would be doing in the future. I read about tons of different occupations and success stories of different people. The majority of those people had an MBA degree, about which I knew nothing at that time. As I later found out, I was too young and inexperienced to apply for a MBA program, so I decided to get a master’s degree in management.</p>
                                        <p>During the first half of my fourth year, I tried to find out as much as possible about applying for a master’s program. It turned out that the GMAT was not mandatory for many of them, but all of the schools considered it an applicant’s advantage. I had relatively much time for preparation, so I wanted to be flexible and to be able to study at any time. The GMAT Cracker Platform was a perfect match. I got a Supreme Prep Pack to have a 5-month access and spent most of that time on watching videos and doing tasks in courses. When I solved all of the problems in courses, I started working with the test generator and kept doing so until the biggest part of the problems were solved. Then I did a diagnostic test, which was a little over 600. Later I contacted a GMAT tutor and explained my situation. He told me that I’d better do more problems in less time and made a personal schedule for me. After I completed the schedule, I scored 670 for my second diagnostic test and 650 for the third. After the third attempt, I scheduled my exam and scored 680. Judging from the experience that I have had with the platform, I can say that it significantly boosted my score. I am sure that if I had studied harder from the very beginning, I would have scored over 700.</p>

                                        <p>Before taking the GMAT, I had already taken IELTS twice to apply for my full-time MBA, so it didn’t bother me too much. However, it was pretty disappointing to see 560 on the screen after completing one of the CATs at mba.com. I immediately started searching for test prep companies and came across one of the Cracker’s ads on the Internet, so I clicked on it and was redirected to gmatcracker.com. After analyzing available online platforms, I chose GMAT Cracker and now I am happy with that choice.</p>
                                        <p>The Supreme Pack, which I finally bought, includes everything I needed. First I had a couple of tutoring sessions, during which Kevin and I made a schedule and set deadlines. Every week during a two-month course I submitted one essay and did about 150 problems (I could not afford to do more because of my job). Also, every two weeks I did a diagnostic test and then discussed my results during tutoring sessions.</p>
                                        <p>The real GMAT was a controversial experience. Although it seemed to me that I was failing question after question, I hit 710 on the first try. I want to say thank you to the whole test prep department and wish good luck with your business!</p>
